# jPokeDex
This is my own version of pokedex built using Java. I built this to participate in JavaJam for JavaDiscord.
The theme of this jam is webcrawler, thus I crawl the pokemon data from https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net.

### How To Run
```
mvn package
cd target
run jar file with-dependencies
```
